In backup-directories.rb, provide means of specifying more descriptive archive
filename than that derived from basename of directory.
  Use case: in Mephisto, directory containing uploaded images is named
  "assets", yielding dir-assets-20080429.tar.bz2, for example. I would prefer
  something like dir-dumbfounderment-assets-20080429.tar.bz2.
Provide means of specifying DirectoryManagerPreset to use from command line of
each of backup-{directories,postgresql}.rb, falling back on "sensible" if none
specified.
